              <span>- <span className='text-[#AE98FF]'>Access Management.</span> Cogniify maintains a formal access management process for the request, review, approval and provisioning of all personnel with access to Customer Personal Data to limit access to Customer Personal Data and systems storing, accessing or transmitting Customer Personal Data to properly authorized persons having a need for such access.

              <span>- <span className='text-[#AE98FF]'>Internal Data Access Processes and Policies.</span> Access Policy. Cogniify&apos;s internal data access processes and policies are designed to protect against unauthorized access, use, disclosure, alteration or destruction of Customer Personal Data. Cogniify designs its systems to only allow authorized persons to access data they are authorized to access based on principles of &quot;least privileged&quot; and &quot;need to know&quot;, and to prevent others who should not have access from obtaining access.  Cogniify requires the use of unique user IDs, strong passwords, two factor authentication and carefully monitored access lists to minimize the potential for unauthorized account use. The granting or modification of access rights is based on: the authorized personnel&apos;s job responsibilities; job duty requirements necessary to perform authorized tasks; a need to know basis; and must be in accordance with Cogniify&apos;s internal data access policies and training. Approvals are managed by workflow tools that maintain audit records of all changes. Access to systems is logged to create an audit trail for accountability. Where passwords are employed for authentication (e.g., login to workstations), password policies follow industry standard practices. These standards include password complexity, password expiry, password lockout, restrictions on password reuse and re-prompt for password after a period of inactivity</span>
