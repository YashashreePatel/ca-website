        </span>
        <span className='pl-[30px] flex flex-col gap-[5px]'>

          Exercising Access, Data Portability, and Deletion Rights
        </span>
        <span>
          To exercise the access, data portability, and deletion rights described above, please submit a verifiable consumer request to us by emailing us at <a className='text-brand-blue' target='blank' href='mailto:info@cogniify.ai'>info@cogniify.ai </a>.
        </span>
        <span>
          Only you, or someone legally authorized to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request related to your personal information. You may also make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of your minor child.
        </span>
        <span>
          You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period. The verifiable consumer request must:
        </span>
        <span className='pl-[30px] flex flex-col gap-[5px]'>
          <span>- Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative.</span>
          <span>- Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.</span>
        </span>
        <span>
          We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you. Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us. We will only use personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor’s identity or authority to make the request.
        </span>

        <span className='italic'>
          Response Timing and Format
        </span>
        <span>
          We endeavor to respond to a verifiable consumer request within forty-five (45) days of its receipt. If we require more time (up to 90 days), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writingby mail or electronically, at your option.
        </span>
        <span>
          Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable consumer request’s receipt. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your personal information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance, specifically in a pdf document or equivalent electronic format.
        </span>
        <span>
          We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.
